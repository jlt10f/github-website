My goal in life is to always continue learning regardless of the occupation I hold.  I am currently working as a Post-Doctoral scholar at the [Quantitative Methodology and Innovation Center](https://www.fcrr.org/projects/projects_qmi.html) at Florida State University with an emphasis on the [Campus Reimagined Project](https://campusreimagined.fsu.edu).  I graduated from FSU with a PhD in Cognitive Psychology and an emphasis in Expert Performance research in the lab of [Anders Ericsson](https://psy.fsu.edu/faculty/ericssonk/ericsson.dp.php).  

The current emphasis of my work is in measurement across educational psychology in addition to other fields where fellow colleagues seek my assistance for completion of methodology and data analyses.

My full CV is available [here](JLT_CV.pdf).
